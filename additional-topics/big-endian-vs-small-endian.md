endian is use to describe how bytes were boing to store inside memory

In big-endian format
Big end or most significant byte was going to store first 

In little-endian format
Least signification value is stored first 

if byte is 4F52 

if big endian 45 will be going to stored at 1000 first and 52 will be on 1001 while in little endian this will be vice versa

in little endian :
as more digits are added to the right , the least significant bytes can stay where they are
