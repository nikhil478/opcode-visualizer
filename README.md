### Project Goal

The purpose of this repository is to develop a Bitcoin Script visualizer that helps users better understand and interact with Bitcoin’s OP (opcode) scripts. 

### Time Commitment

As I am working on this project solo and without any external sponsorship, my progress will be dependent on the time I can dedicate to it. Unfortunately, I cannot commit to any specific deadlines at this time. I will contribute to the project whenever I have the availability to do so.

### Approach

1. **Backend Development:**
   The initial focus will be on building a backend application. I’ll begin by implementing a set of constant OP codes, which will simulate the pushing of values onto the stack. This will allow for basic script validation—specifically, checking whether the script is valid or not. In the future, I aim to extend this by creating a mechanism to dynamically generate unlocking scripts with customizable outputs, although this is not the priority at the moment. Initially, the tool will accept input via a command-line interface (CLI), with potential expansion to a frontend interface in the future.

2. **Interactive Stack Visualization:**
   The key feature of this tool is the interactive stack visualization. Users will be able to see how the stack evolves as different OP codes are executed, which will provide a more intuitive understanding of Bitcoin Script operations. 

### Why This Tool?

During my own learning process, I found it difficult to visualize and test Bitcoin OP codes in a practical and interactive manner. Existing tools were either too complex or lacked the ability to offer detailed insights into individual operations. This visualizer will provide an interactive platform where:
   
   - **DFA Graphs** are generated to show the flow of execution.
   - **Hovering over OP codes** will reveal detailed descriptions of each operation and its intended effect.
   
This tool will not only help beginners understand Bitcoin Script but will also be invaluable for debugging and testing Bitcoin scripts in real time. While my focus is currently on the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) blockchain, this visualizer will be extendable to other blockchains that use similar OP code systems, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Fractal Bitcoin, and even experimental chains like EarthBucks.

### Next Steps

1. **Backend Implementation**: Start with constant OP codes and basic validation logic.
2. **Interactive Visualizer**: Develop an interactive frontend to visualize the execution of Bitcoin scripts and the changes to the stack.

This tool is aimed at both newcomers who want to understand Bitcoin Script and advanced users who need a reliable debugging tool.
